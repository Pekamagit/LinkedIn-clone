LinkedIn HOMEPAGE AND PROFILE PAGE CLONE PROJECT

This is a major project for me as a junior front-end Engineer. Doing this project gave me an indepth knowledge on how to use HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT to design a website, make it responsive and interactive. Some of the things I learnt From this project are:

  * How to use CSS animation (the blue lines that appears under the nav) on the navigation options
  * How to design a sticky navigation bar.
  * How to define my design structure, layout and style, responsive and interactive.
    E.T.C.....
  * How to link a profile page to the main page.
  * How to design a visible and disappearing drop-down menu when the nav profile pic is clicked.
   
I was able to carryout this project through the video tutorial of @Greatstack (Easy Tutorial) on Youtube.
